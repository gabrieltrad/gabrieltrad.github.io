This is a subtitling of *A Doida* (translated as *The Hag*), a 1970s short film based on the eponymous story by Carlos Drummond de Andrade. It was made during the Audiovisual Translation class using Subtitle Edit. You can check the original video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul7JMYEmFTY">YouTube</a>.
The film is about a old lady named by other *a doida*, which means literally *crazy lady*. The word *Hag* was used because, according to <a href="https://https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hag">Merrian-Webster dictionary</a>, it means *an ugly, evil-looking old woman*, which fits with the description of the character.
